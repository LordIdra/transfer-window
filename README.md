## How to run
1) Install cargo, rust's build toool
2) Clone the repository
3) `git checkout` a branch. **The master branch doesn't work very well.** You have two options:
- The `dagsoc-demo` branch. This is an older commit which includes stations and slot editing.
- The `tutorial-stable`. This is a newer commit without stations or slot editing, but has 4 tutorial levels (the last being incomplete). This version is a bit less stable and has some more obvious bugs.
4) Run `cargo run --profile=profiling`
5) Hopefully it works...
