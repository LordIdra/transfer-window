# Current tasks
- [1|x] MVC split
- [1|x] Rendering backend
- [1|x] Primitive planet rendering as sphere
- [1|x] Refocus selected object
- [1|x] Drag to move focus
- [1|x] Load/save games
- [1|x] Display current time
- [1|x] Speed up / slow down time
- [1|x] Build default model
- [1|x] Render icons (different types for different objects)
- [1|x] Click icon to focus object
- [1|x] Overlapping icons render with a priority system
- [1|x] Intelligent conic rendering
- [1|x] Update orbit state
- [1|x] Select a point on orbit
- [1|x] Display warp speed
- [1|x] Show time of selected point
- [1|x] Warp to point on orbit
- [1|x] Can create burn
- [1|x] Burn icons
- [1|x] Select burns by default
- [1|x] Prioritise currently selected icon
- [1|x] Burn can be adjusted (at all)
- [1|x] Better burn adjustment system
- [1|x] Intelligent burn rendering
- [1|x] Fast solver for burns
- [1|x] Fix burn adjustment logic not triggering when over icon??
- [1|x] Fix adjusting burn while spacecraft encounters it causing crash
- [1|x] Fix only granular adjustments to burn
- [1|x] Warp to burn button
- [1|x] Add FPS counter
- [1|x] Fix being able to create burns for orbitables
- [1|x] Make segment point selection snap to nearest segment
- [1|x] View N orbits into future on the selected orbit
- [1|x] Fix freezes when focus enters burn
- [1|x] Show scale somewhere (how long 1m, 1k, etc is)
- [1|x] Fix clicking another burn point causes state change on selected one
- [1|x] Visual indicator of how much DV burn will use
- [1|x] Fix icons showing for burns that are underway
- [1|x] The next segment should take precedence over orbits when rendering (ie render segments backwards)
- [1|x] Allow deleting burns
- [1|x] Fix selection breaking down on high eccentricity orbits
- [1|x] More logical time step system
- [1|x] Adjusting/deleting/creating a burn with subsequent burns cannot be done, other burns must be deleted first
- [1|x] Better color scheme for orbits/burns
- [1|x] Limit prediction by number of conics as well as time
- [1|x] Periapsis/apoapsis indicators
- [1|x] Fix current segment does not exist nonsense
- [1|x] Just fade icons when overlapped instead of hiding completely 
- [1|x] Completely deselect segment point when UI hovered
- [1|x] Add logging to find/fix issues with solver, it keeps panicking
- [1|x] Right clicking vessels brings up context menu
- [1|x] Target option in the vessel menu selects vessel as 'target' relative to current vessel
- [1|x] Target is highlighted/circled
- [1|x] Show closest encounter for target and selected
- [1|x] Allow vessels to be deleted without crashing everything (oh god)
- [1|x] Add ship classes with system slot schema
- [1|x] Add system slots for propulsion + fuel tanks
- [1|x] Add light/heavy ships
- [1|x] Add fuel tanks
- [1|x] Add engines
- [1|x] Create GUI for editing system slots and add ship layout texture
- [1|x] Show current systems in system slots
- [1| ] Allow editing current systems
- [1| ] Show remaining DV + fuel bar in vessel top left GUI
- [1| ] Cannot create new burns if no engines or out of fuel
- [1| ] Reduce DV/fuel while burning
- [1| ] Burns cannot use more DV than ship has including previous burns
- [1| ] Add torpedo system
- [1| ] Show active weapons at bottom of screen (simple for now)
- [1| ] Allow a weapon to be locked onto a target
- [1| ] Cannot fire until firing solution computed
- [1| ] Once a weapon is locked, click button to confirm fire
- [1| ] Add torpedo component
- [1| ] Spawn new torpedo at ship location
- [1| ] Torpedo burns directly towards target until fuel expended
- [1| ] Yeet torpedo target when torpedo gets close enough
- [1| ] Torpedo guidance system

# Stuff to do later because more stuff needs to be in place first
- [1| ] Games have names
- [1| ] Choose game to load
- [1| ] Dim P/A icons when moused over and don't count as hovered????
- [1| ] Hide all child icons and segments of object when zoomed out far enough
- [1| ] Some way to see distance/altitude and time at apoapsis/periapsis and especially at closest encounters
- [1| ] Show orbital parameters

# On TODO list
- [1| ] Ballistic weaponry
- [1| ] Point defense
- [1| ] PDC automatic targeting system
- [1| ] PDC range or time dropoff after which they are deleted to prevent bullet lag
- [1| ] PDC shells not affected by gravity?
