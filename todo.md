- [1|x] Allow deleting burns
- [1|x] Fix selection breaking down on high eccentricity orbits
- [1|x] More logical time step system
- [1|x] Adjusting/deleting/creating a burn with subsequent burns cannot be done, other burns must be deleted first

- [1|x] Show current systems in system slots
- [1|x] Allow editing current systems
- [1|x] System tooltips
- [1|x] Close button for vessel editor
- [1|x] Show remaining DV + fuel bar in vessel top left GUI
- [1|x] Disallow changing modules to change burns
- [1|x] Vessel mass should account for remaining fuel
- [1|x] Cannot create new burns if no engines or out of fuel
- [1|x] Reduce DV/fuel while burning
- [1|x] Add torpedo system
- [1|x] Show active weapons at bottom of screen (simple for now)
- [1|x] Click button to confirm fire
- [1|x] Allow deselecting objects
- [1|x] Show target on all selected objects
- [1|x] Can adjust initial trajectory before firing
- [1|x] Preview of initial trajectory
- [1|x] Spawn new torpedo at ship location with trajectory
- [1|x] Allow deleting and warping to fire torpedo events
- [1|x] Update deletion logic for burns and launch events
- [1|x] Disallow creating events before last event
- [1|x] Torpedo stockpile
- [1| ] Torpedo launcher needs to re-arm
- [1| ] Min/max zoom levels....
- [1| ] Torpedoes have some velocity by default so they're not just buried under the ship icon
- [1| ] Icons per vessel class
- [1| ] Torpedo APN guidance system
- [1| ] Yeet torpedo target when torpedo gets close enough
- [1| ] Burns cannot use more DV than ship has including previous burns
- [1| ] Show DV budget while adjusting burns
- [1| ] Replace most buttons with icons and add tooltips
- [1| ] General UI improvements (cross that bridge later)

# Stuff to do later because other stuff needs to be in place first
- [1| ] Dim P/A icons when moused over and don't count as hovered????
- [1| ] Hide all child icons and segments of object when zoomed out far enough
- [1| ] Some way to see distance/altitude and time at apoapsis/periapsis and especially at closest encounters
- [1| ] Show orbital parameters
- [1| ] Only allow one of each event to prevent double-clicks in a frame causing unexpected behaviour

# On TODO list
- [1| ] Ballistic weaponry
- [1| ] Point defense
- [1| ] PDC automatic targeting system
- [1| ] PDC range or time dropoff after which they are deleted to prevent bullet lag
- [1| ] PDC shells not affected by gravity?
- [1| ] Switch to Pade approximation of EKE for better performance in singular corner (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576522005999)
- [1| ] Collisions with planets (nearly forgot about that lmao)
